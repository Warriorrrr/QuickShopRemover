## QuickShopRemover

Small extension plugin for QuickShop-Reremake and Towny. Removes any Quickshops in Towny wilderness.

(Probably) doesn't work well with servers that don't use the default 16x16 Townblock size setting in Towny.

Required versions:
- [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny) 0.96.5.7 or higher
- [QuickShop-Reremake](https://github.com/Ghost-chu/QuickShop-Reremake) 4.0.6.3 or higher
